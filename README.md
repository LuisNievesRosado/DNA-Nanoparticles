# DNA-Nanoparticles
Code base for DNA Nanoparticle Work

EVAL - Code to evaluate results from coarse grained simulations.

IP - Code to setup Interfacial Pinning Simulations

MISC - Other code

ML - Machine learning code for autonomous simulation

PMF - Code to compute PMF of a specific design using HREX and post process to obtain coarse grained models.

DWFiles - Files for Double Well Nanoparticle designs, WIP

! Note: Most of this code was done for self use research and as such does not follow software writing best practices at times. Currently in the process of rewriting to improve this.
